1 # spectrum style code; 1 = within a given latitude range, over equally-sized mu bins
-2.0 1.0 # minimum latitude, maximum latitude (planetocentric?)
8 # total number of mu bins. if odd, will have center bin straddling the meridian (probably best).  If even, will have a bin split by the meridian
1 # on/off switch for averaging across the meridian. 1 = will average radiance from same mu bins across meridian. 0 = will keep them seperate
