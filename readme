Spextraction is a code initially written and set up to pull spectra from 2 emission angle bins from Jupiter images taken by SpeX. Eventually, the hope is to generalize the code to other instruments, spectral bins, etc.

To run spextraction:

1. Download spextraction_2.py from github onto sansa; probably easiest to download it locally and then scp it over to sansa

2. Copy + paste the text in kurucz_HST_IRTF.dat on my github into a text file on sansa. Thisâ€™ll be your solar reference file

3. Make a text file containing the paths+names of the files you want to use to make your spectra; they need to have the same wavelengths as those available from the meancm*.sav files, and only 1 image per wavelength, all from the same night.
Note: remember that when you save maps for these images, they will overwrite any that already exist at the same wavelength. Always make a new directory, probably with a name including the observation date, to save the maps to. 

4. Make sure you have the other necessary input files and know where you want to save the .spx file.

5. Make sure your .cshrc file contains the following 2 lines:
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /opt/intel/intelpython3/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
set path = (/home/emmadahl/anaconda3/bin/ $path)
If not, add them, save and source your .cshrc file. Probably a good idea to close and re-open your shell as well. 

5. Before running spextraction, make sure you have pylanetary installed. Enter
    $ conda activate /home/emmadahl/anaconda3/envs/pylanetary-tester/
    And if you haven't yet,
    $ pip install uncertainties
This should activate the conda environment you need. I'm under the impression that you only need to install the uncertainties package within pylanetary-tester once.

6. Open spextraction_2.py (not the ipynb!), edit your paths or any other variables at the top of the file. 

7. Run it! $ python spextraction_2.py

8. If ran successfully, should make a .spx file and a PDF plot of the I/F spectra

Tip: Turn off plot_maps when running spextraction remotely, otherwise the interactive plotting will slow things way down.
